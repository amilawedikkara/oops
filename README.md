# Object-Oriented Browser Programming Repository

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Browser Programming** course repository! This repository contains Node.js code examples structured by lessons, focusing on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles applied in the context of browser-based development.

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific lesson, containing code examples and related materials:

```
ðŸ“‚ lesson-1
   â”œâ”€â”€ example1.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ example2.js
   
ðŸ“‚ lesson-2
   â”œâ”€â”€ example1.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ example2.js
   
...
ðŸ“‚ lesson-n
   â”œâ”€â”€ example1.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ example2.js
   
```

- **lesson-x**: Represents a specific lesson topic.
- **exampleX.js**: Node.js code examples demonstrating key concepts.
- **README.md** (inside lesson folders): Explanation of lesson concepts and usage instructions.
